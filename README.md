##Background and Problem Statement

Kenya, with its cultural diversity and dynamic economic landscape, has been a key recipient of donor-funded projects aimed at achieving development goals in education, health, infrastructure, and poverty reduction. Despite significant investments, many projects fail due to poor planning, inadequate resource allocation, and inefficient management. The absence of predictive tools makes it difficult to anticipate project success or failure.
The problem is predicting the success of donor-funded projects in Kenya. Many initiatives fail to achieve their intended goals due to inefficient resource allocation and lack of effective management. This results in wasted funding, unmet development objectives, and reduced donor confidence. The goal is to develop a predictive system that leverages machine learning models to forecast project success, enabling data-driven decision-making to optimize resource allocation and improve project outcomes.

Objectives 
1.	Develop an interactive web application using Streamlit to visualise and analyse donor-funded project data.
2.	Integrate predictive models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting) to forecast project success.
3.	Provide a user-friendly interface for stakeholders to explore project data and generate insights.
4.	Test and validate the application's accuracy, reliability, and usability.

Data Type and Size 
The dataset for this project will be sourced form an open-source data platform named OpenAfrica. The data will include structured data on donor-funded projects in Kenya with features of the dataset including project name and description, funding amount and sources, project duration, stakeholder involvement, monitoring and evaluation indicators and success metrics. Data cleaning and preprocessing will be performed to handle missing values and standardize features for analysis. The dataset is structured, comprising tabular records of project details, and is expected to include thousands of entries to ensure robust model training and validation.
Models and Techniques 
This project will employ the following predictive modeling techniques:
1.	Logistic Regression: A simple and interpretable model for binary classification of project success.
2.	Decision Trees: A rule-based approach for identifying key factors influencing project outcomes.
3.	Random Forest: An ensemble technique that improves accuracy by aggregating multiple decision trees.
4.	Gradient Boosting (XGBoost): A powerful method that iteratively improves predictions by minimizing errors.
These models were selected based on their ability to handle classification tasks effectively. Logistic Regression provides interpretability, while Decision Trees and Random Forest offer enhanced decision-making capabilities. Gradient Boosting is included due to its high predictive accuracy and effectiveness in handling complex patterns in data.
